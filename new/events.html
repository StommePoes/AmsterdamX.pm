        :: Playing with shiny things: Introduction to Elixir
      </h4>
      <p>Erlang! Functional programming! Concurrency! Distributed systems! Nine nines uptime! Custom sigils! (wait, custom sigils??)</p>
      <p>Elixir is a nifty language built on top of the Erlang VM -- it pairs the Erlang superpowers (concurrency, reliability, distributed systems) with a Ruby-ish syntax and some revisions/reinterpretations of the Erlang standard library.</p>
      <p>We&apos;ll go through some of the strong and weak points, then build a simple application together.</p>
      <p>Along the way, we&apos;ll compare some of the properties of the Erlang concurrency model to the event loops we often use for writing asynchronous programs in Perl.</p>

      </h4>
      <p>A lean and mean XS module that gathers runtime code coverage information</p>
      <p>We will briefly describe how Perl uses an optree and how we can hook into it for our own nefarious purposes.</p>
      <p>Then we will discuss the very simple implementation of Devel::QuickCover, which tracks what lines in each loaded Perl module are actually executed.</p>
      <p>The talk will end with some real world instances of using Devel::QuickCover.</p>

        <span>Stefan Hornburg (Racke) (30 min)</span>
        :: DBIx::Class - Can of Worms || Best Thing Since Sliced Bread
      </h4>
      <p>DBIx::Class is both a very useful tool for applications using SQL databases and an intimidating piece of software.</p>
      <p>You can find comprehensive documentation about DBIx::Class on CPAN, but it is not easy to find the stuff that makes it the best thing since sliced bread.</p>
      <p>In this talk we brush through the rough edges of DBIx::Class and look how they can be alleviated with goodies like Candy, Helpers and other amazing add-ons for DBIx::Class.</p>
      <p>Also I will make a case why using DBIx::Class is a splendid idea, for example getting rid of embedded SQL, painless database upgrades and keeping the business logic outside of your main applications.</p>

      <h4>
        <span>Julian Levens</span>
        :: Proper symlinks for Windows perl (30 min)
      </h4>
      <p>Windows has had hardlinks and junctions for some time (circa 2000). However, you needed to call the Windows API to use them. For perl circa 2004 Win32::Hardlink and Win32::Symlink came to CPAN but as junctions are not symlinks these are not a seamless replacement. Since Vista, Windows has had POSIX compliant symlinks. This talk will cover the development of Win32::Links to transparently support symlinks in Windows perl scripts.</p>

      <h4>
        <span>Maxim Vuets</span>
        :: very iterators. so lazy. amaze! (20 min)
      </h4>
      <p>An iterator is a neat concept to hide complexities of accessing a data collection behind a simple interface. Moreover it enables one to benefit from lazy evaluation, modular code design, and code-as-data.</p>
      <p>In this talk I want to refresh your memory on Perl built-in iterators and closures. Then take an iterator-less example of code and step-by-step bring it to an iterator-ful shape.</p>
      <p>Don&apos;t be hold off by all the buzz words---I&apos;ll have kittens!</p>

      <h4>
        <span>Eli Abramovitch</span>
        :: Breathing life into perl with an Intellij Plugin
      </h4>
      <p>We all love perl and it&apos;s been long overdue to have a decent IDE to support it.</p>
      <p>In order to make our coding life more easier and attract more new developers - we created Perl Intellij Plugin.</p>
      <p>In this talk I will demonstrate the plugin benefits and how it contributes to the daily life of a Perl hacker.</p>
    </li>

      <h4>
        <span>Mathias RÃ¸rbo Jessen</span>
        :: PowerShell - Next-level Automation in Windows-land
      </h4>
      <p>Since late 2006, a new scripting language has come to dominate the way IT Pros manage Windows-centric environments. What is PowerShell, where did it come from, does it bring anything new to the table and what&apos;s up with the weird mix of C# and Perl-like syntax? This talk will try to answer some of those question!</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>
        <span>Maxim Vuets</span>
        :: Processing toki pona with Perl
      </h4>
      <p>Toki pona is a constructed language, it strives for making the world simple. Perl is a programming language, it&apos;s known to be good at text processing (mangling? cruching?). They both are good, TIMTOWTDI, fun and intensively rely on context.</p>
      <p>In this talk I want to take Perl to the next level and demonstrate how it can be applied for language processing (mangling? crunching?) using toki pona as an example. We will take a look at parsing free-form text with a help of Marpa and writting a rubbish generator with the help of Markov chains.</p>

        :: Warm and fuzzy text matching
      </h4>
      <p>I had a problem: got two somewhat-structured music playlists that were overlapping and I wanted to merge them together.</p>
      <p>In this talk I will explain what fuzzy text matching is; cover a couple of techniques to do it; and showcase how Text::Fuzzy helped me to solve the problem. Colored terminal examples included.</p>

        <span>Peter Rabbitson (Ribasushi)</span>
        :: From 2D to Tree-D
      </h4>
      <p>This talk will go over the internals of the DBIC rowparser, showcasing a practical example when code generation is useful (and thus justified). This is purely an algorithmic presentation - no knowledge of DBIC or even databases is necessary.</p>
    </li>

      <h4>
        <span>Ben Tyler</span>
        :: Distributed Systems 102: CRDTs for Poets and Perl Hackers
      </h4>
      <p>In which a humanities major reads a bunch of papers on distributed systems theory and attempts to explain them in plain language.</p>
      <p>Fortunately, conflict free replicated data types (CRDTs) are just a straightforward monotonically increasing join semi-lattice with a least upper bound accomplished by enforcing idempotent and commutative merge functions (producing strong eventual consistency as long as the transport is eventually reliable). No sweat!</p>
      <p>Come learn about conflict free replicated data types, what they can do for you, and why they might be interesting for all kinds of applications, not just for the Amazons and Googles of the world.</p>

        <span>Andrew Shitov</span>
        :: Parallel Features of Perl 6
      </h4>
      <p>I&apos;d like to talk about things for parallel computing, which are available in the Perl 6 language. The long-lasting design process made these features so syntactically simple that it&apos;s not always possible to instantly understand the real power of them. I&apos;d like to share my current understanding of what we&apos;ve got in Perl 6 today.</p>

    <li>
      <h4>
        <span>Ben Tyler</span>
        :: Mojo::Pg and managing callbacks with Mojo::IOLoop::Delay
      </h4>
      <p>Still feeling Node.js envy? Looking longingly at the Go master class at YAPC::NA? Wait! Perl has you covered! Mojo::Pg is a lovely little wrapper around the asynchronous bits of DBD::Pg: it allows your web app to serve other requests while the database is crunching on that hairy query with fifteen JOINs. When combined with the world&apos;s tiniest callback manager (Mojo::IOLoop::Delay), you end up with a set of tools for writing sane async web applications without overflowing the right margin of your editor. Good times!</p>

      <h4>
        <span>Abigail</span>
        :: Sharding a database
      </h4>
      <p>When an organization grows, the database(s) it may reach a point where it will be reaching one or more of its resource limits. Action will be needed, and one of the solutions is to use a sharded setup; that is, having several databases with identical structure, and data residing in one (or subset) of the databases.</p>
      <p>At Booking.com, we have several sharded databases. In this talk, we will look how we transformed a highly volatile database to a sharded setup, without its users noticing and how Perl helped us to achieve this.</p>
    </li>

      </h4>
      <p>There will be no slides in this presentation. It will be one big live demo. During the talk we will create a mini compiler for the mini language using the Perl 6 grammars.</p>
      <p>Along the talk, elements of the new syntax and concepts available in Perl 6 will be emphasised when needed.</p>
      <p>Also, this is to demonstrate that today&apos;s Perl 6 can be used and debugged in real time.</p>

      <h4>
        <span>Stevan Little</span>
        :: Designing with Roles
      </h4>
      <p>Roles (originally called Traits) are a concept that originated in research being done into better OO design practices using the Smalltalk language. Early in the Perl 6 design process Roles were added to the language and have since become an integral part of Perl 6. The idea of roles were also adopted by the Perl 5 community, which has many implementations of them, including Moose::Role, Moo::Role, Role::Tiny and more.</p>
      <p>In this talk, we will discuss some of the core concepts of roles and how they fit into and augment the normal OO design process. We will also spend some time looking at some of the well established patterns of Role usage, discussing the pros and cons of each approach.</p>

      <p>Will it be YET ANOTHER FREAKIN&apos; MOP? Will it be a new language I enjoyed working with? Is it The 10 Best Coding Practices of 2014 or The Worst, Most-Shared BuzzFeed Articles I will be covering? The subject of this talk is going to surprise you. Hell, it&apos;s going to surprise me!</p>
      <p>Join me (or don&apos;t) to hear magical stories of enchanted youths fooled by enigmatic and theatrical descriptions in order to attend a still-vaguely-themed talk of a questionable topic.</p>

        :: What I miss in &quot;pack&quot; and &quot;unpack&quot;
      </h4>
      <p>Pack and unpack enable us to view binary data as structured data. Using advanced patterns, these data chunks might even be perceived as dynamic data sources. There is one drawback on the implementation of unpack in the CORE: it only works on scalar values.</p>
      <p>I will not show you how it can be done (that will be quite an job), but I will try to show you how code could change if unpack were to work on data streams as well. I&apos;ll use PerlMonk posts as examples, though my original idea came from something I&apos;ll also show.</p>
      <p>I hope this will be some kind of interactive, and there will be a discussion on weather this is a useful feature to implement. It will not be a slick slideshow.</p>

      <p>This has changed in the last years, and perl is released on a frequent schedule, with many people (&quot;release managers&quot;) taking turns and making a release of perl. In this talk, we will look at what it takes to make a perl release, and show that &quot;everyone&quot; is able to become a release manager.</p>
      <p>Abigail can speak from personal experiences, having released perl twice before. Abigail is also the acting release manager, and will do a release at the end of July 2014.</p>

      <p>This talk presents how Rex works, shows a few use-cases, gives examples and ideas on how to solve recurring tasks by automating them away.</p>

      <p>But all is not lost. While underground, Perl has schemed a plot to overthrow the competitors. That plan is Plack/PSGI.</p>
