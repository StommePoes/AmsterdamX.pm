    title: Playing with shiny things: Introduction to Elixir
    details:
      - Erlang! Functional programming! Concurrency! Distributed systems! Nine nines uptime! Custom sigils! (wait, custom sigils??)
      - Elixir is a nifty language built on top of the Erlang VM -- it pairs the Erlang superpowers (concurrency, reliability, distributed systems) with a Ruby-ish syntax and some revisions/reinterpretations of the Erlang standard library.
      - We'll go through some of the strong and weak points, then build a simple application together.
      - Along the way, we'll compare some of the properties of the Erlang concurrency model to the event loops we often use for writing asynchronous programs in Perl.
