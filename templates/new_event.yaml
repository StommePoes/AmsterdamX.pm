    speaker: Stevan Little
    title: Big world, Little Stevan
    details:
        - Revealing truths (without revealing), exposed secrets (without exposing), promises and lies, love and deceit, actions and consequences, mystery and brutal honesty, one word juxtapositioned against another.
        - Will it be YET ANOTHER FREAKIN' MOP? Will it be a new language I enjoyed working with? Is it The 10 Best Coding Practices of 2014 or The Worst, Most-Shared BuzzFeed Articles I will be covering? The subject of this talk is going to surprise you. Hell, it's going to surprise me!
        - Join me (or don't) to hear magical stories of enchanted youths fooled by enigmatic and theatrical descriptions in order to attend a still-vaguely-themed talk of a questionable topic.
        - I will also apologize for not providing talk descriptions ahead of time which made Sawyer X write mine.

    speaker: Borislav Nikolov (jackdoe)
    title: Extreme (Elastic)Search
    details:
      - "This is a story about search, distributed systems, complexity, tackling extreme conditions, and about which decisions we made at Booking.com to make it work."
      - "P.S.: The talk has almost nothing to do with Perl."

  -
    speaker: Mickey Nasriachi
    title: A killer API for a killer feature
    details:
        - CPAN is Perl's killer feature.
        - The information available in CPAN is massive, but without a proper API, it's difficult to work with.
        - MetaCPAN provides this API, and MetaCPAN::Client provides the ability to work with the API in a sophisticated and comfortable way.

    speaker: Sawyer X
    title: Modern web scrapping
    details:
        - Web scrapping is fun. It makes data accessible, works around API limits, and makes us feel like gods.
        - I'll show Web::Query, a module I joyfully started using recently in my scrapping, and few examples on stuff I've scrapped with it.
