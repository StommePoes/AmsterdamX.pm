    title: Breathing life into perl with an Intellij Plugin
    details:
      - We all love perl and it's been long overdue to have a decent IDE to support it.
      - In order to make our coding life more easier and attract more new developers - we created Perl Intellij Plugin.
      - In this talk I will demonstrate the plugin benefits and how it contributes to the daily life of a Perl hacker.

    title: PowerShell - Next-level Automation in Windows-land
    details:
      - Since late 2006, a new scripting language has come to dominate the way IT Pros manage Windows-centric environments. What is PowerShell, where did it come from, does it bring anything new to the table and what's up with the weird mix of C# and Perl-like syntax? This talk will try to answer some of those question!

    title: Processing toki pona with Perl
    details:
      - Toki pona is a constructed language, it strives for making the world simple. Perl is a programming language, it's known to be good at text processing (mangling? cruching?). They both are good, TIMTOWTDI, fun and intensively rely on context.
      - In this talk I want to take Perl to the next level and demonstrate how it can be applied for language processing (mangling? crunching?) using toki pona as an example. We will take a look at parsing free-form text with a help of Marpa and writting a rubbish generator with the help of Markov chains.
