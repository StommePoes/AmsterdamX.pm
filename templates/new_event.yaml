    title: DBIx::Class - Can of Worms || Best Thing Since Sliced Bread
    details:
      - DBIx::Class is both a very useful tool for applications using SQL databases and an intimidating piece of software.
      - You can find comprehensive documentation about DBIx::Class on CPAN, but it is not easy to find the stuff that makes it the best thing since sliced bread.
      - In this talk we brush through the rough edges of DBIx::Class and look how they can be alleviated with goodies like Candy, Helpers and other amazing add-ons for DBIx::Class.
      - Also I will make a case why using DBIx::Class is a splendid idea, for example getting rid of embedded SQL, painless database upgrades and keeping the business logic outside of your main applications.
