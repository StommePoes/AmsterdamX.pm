    title: Sharding a database
    details:
        - When an organization grows, the database(s) it may reach a point where it will be reaching one or more of its resource limits. Action will be needed, and one of the solutions is to use a sharded setup; that is, having several databases with identical structure, and data residing in one (or subset) of the databases.
        - At Booking.com, we have several sharded databases. In this talk, we will look how we transformed a highly volatile database to a sharded setup, without its users noticing and how Perl helped us to achieve this.

    title: Designing with Roles
    details:
        - Roles (originally called Traits) are a concept that originated in research being done into better OO design practices using the Smalltalk language. Early in the Perl 6 design process Roles were added to the language and have since become an integral part of Perl 6. The idea of roles were also adopted by the Perl 5 community, which has many implementations of them, including Moose::Role, Moo::Role, Role::Tiny and more.
        - In this talk, we will discuss some of the core concepts of roles and how they fit into and augment the normal OO design process. We will also spend some time looking at some of the well established patterns of Role usage, discussing the pros and cons of each approach.
