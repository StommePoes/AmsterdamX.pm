    title: Devel::QuickCover - Quick & dirty code coverage for Perl
    details:
      - A lean and mean XS module that gathers runtime code coverage information
      - We will briefly describe how Perl uses an optree and how we can hook into it for our own nefarious purposes.
      - Then we will discuss the very simple implementation of Devel::QuickCover, which tracks what lines in each loaded Perl module are actually executed.
      - The talk will end with some real world instances of using Devel::QuickCover.

    speaker: Dana Jacobsen
    title: Practical Cryptography
    details:
      - This talk will discuss cryptographic hashes, signing with DSA, encrypting with RSA, and random numbers.
      - Rather than discussing the theory and the hundreds of modules available, the focus is on a few good tools to get things done.

    title: Rust inside Perl
    details:
      - Rust is a new systems language with strong focus on memory safety.
      - It tries to help programmers write more correct code with as little runtime overhead as possible.
      - XS is an interface used by the perl interpreter to talk to native code, built on top of the C language.
      - This project's goal is to bring XS API to Rust and explore ways Rust can make development of well behaved perl extensions simpler.
