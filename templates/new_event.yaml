    title: Proper symlinks for Windows perl (30 min)
    details:
      - Windows has had hardlinks and junctions for some time (circa 2000). However, you needed to call the Windows API to use them. For perl circa 2004 Win32::Hardlink and Win32::Symlink came to CPAN but as junctions are not symlinks these are not a seamless replacement. Since Vista, Windows has had POSIX compliant symlinks. This talk will cover the development of Win32::Links to transparently support symlinks in Windows perl scripts.

    title: very iterators. so lazy. amaze! (20 min)
    details:
      - An iterator is a neat concept to hide complexities of accessing a data collection behind a simple interface. Moreover it enables one to benefit from lazy evaluation, modular code design, and code-as-data.
      - In this talk I want to refresh your memory on Perl built-in iterators and closures. Then take an iterator-less example of code and step-by-step bring it to an iterator-ful shape.
      - Don't be hold off by all the buzz words---I'll have kittens!
