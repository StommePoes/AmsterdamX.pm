    title: Parallel Features of Perl 6
    details:
      - I'd like to talk about things for parallel computing, which are available in the Perl 6 language. The long-lasting design process made these features so syntactically simple that it's not always possible to instantly understand the real power of them. I'd like to share my current understanding of what we've got in Perl 6 today.

    title: Mojo::Pg and managing callbacks with Mojo::IOLoop::Delay
    details:
      - "Still feeling Node.js envy? Looking longingly at the Go master class at YAPC::NA? Wait! Perl has you covered! Mojo::Pg is a lovely little wrapper around the asynchronous bits of DBD::Pg: it allows your web app to serve other requests while the database is crunching on that hairy query with fifteen JOINs. When combined with the world's tiniest callback manager (Mojo::IOLoop::Delay), you end up with a set of tools for writing sane async web applications without overflowing the right margin of your editor. Good times!"
