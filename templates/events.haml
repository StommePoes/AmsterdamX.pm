        :: Programming Slides
      %p Every time I write slides I want something different, and each time the tool I used previously does not quite fit the next talk. After having used plain HTML, Magic Point, S5, LibreOffice Impress, and PDF::API2, I'm probably settling on PostScript for some time.

        :: Perl and the Web - A Love Story
      %p In the beginning of the great kingdom of the Internet, there was one ruler: Perl. With time, fallen from grace, the beautiful princess language lost its place on the throne, giving way to Ruby, Python, and to the dismay and horror of everyone in the kingdom, PHP.
      %p But all is not lost. While underground, Perl has schemed a plot to overthrow the competitors. That plan is Plack/PSGI.
